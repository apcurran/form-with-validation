Form example with custom validation

[Link](https://apcurran.github.io/form-with-validation/)

Features:

-Custom validation using JavaScript

-CSS Grid and Flexbox used throughout

-Animations for links and main container (slide in effect)

-Mobile-friendly layout


Notes: I had a lot of fun making this form and the animations :).  This was my first experience using the Constraint Validation API with JS to check for validation.  However, I also have experience using the built-in HTML 5 validation attributes as well!
